# Machine Learning Algorithms: Naive Bayes
This repository contains an implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm as part of my machine learning studies. It includes simple Naive Bayes model, along with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project serves as a foundational step in understanding and applying supervised learning techniques.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute!
